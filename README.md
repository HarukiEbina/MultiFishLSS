# `MultiFishLSS` - Multi-tracer Fisher forecasts for large-scale structure surveys
Software to generate multi-tracer Fisher forecasts for large-scale structure surveys, including non-linear clustering from the one-loop power spectrum, and cross-correlation with CMB lensing. 
Much of the code structure is inherited from the (single-tracer) Fisher forecast code `FishLSS` [this paper](https://github.com/NoahSailer/FishLSS).

If you make use of this code please cite [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13166).
